# Notes to questions 1-4


## Question1
exercise1.py [-t] [-m (1|2)]
I've implemented two functions resolving the problem. The first (-m 1) uses a comprensive list to calculate all diferences for every position. It's a literal translation of the method explained in the question. It has a complexity of O(nÂ²-n)

The second (-m 2) is a iterative version that save the minimum element for every position and calculate the diference for this number. It has a complexity of O(n)

If we use the -t parameter it runs the same random samples (1000) and compares the execution time. (No entry data are needed)

## Question2
It isn't specified if the domain name can contain a uppercase (i.e HackerRank.Com, Hackerrank.com,...) So i've added that posibility in the RE.
## Question3 & 4
I've used some functions to structure the code and make it more readable. A monstrous comprehension list is difficult to maintain.
